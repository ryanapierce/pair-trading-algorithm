This repository contains the files and programs necessary to implement a pair trading algorithm in the stock market.

## What Is Pair Trading?
Pair trading is a strategy of investing that seeks to capitalize on price discrepancies between two related stocks. This strategy enables traders to identify and exploit specialized conditions in the market as an arbitrage opportunity. By taking a long position in the undervalued stock and a short position in the overvalued stock, traders can reduce their risk and lock in potential profits.

### Overview
The pair trading algorithm will consist of several steps. The first step is to identify the asset pairs that may be suitable for pairs trading. This will be done by first examining the historical price data for each asset pair to determine if a statistically significant relationship exists. After a suitable pair has been identified, the second step will be to track the asset’s price movements and calculate the spread between them. If the spread meets certain criteria, a trade will be triggered. The data used for this project will be obtained from a publicly available source, Yahoo Finance. After our model is ran, the results will be visualized using line graphs and heatmaps.

## Requirements
In order to use the pair trading algorithm program, you will need Python 3 and the libraries listed in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

## Usage
To implement the pair trading algorithm, simply use the [file name] program. You can customize the algorithm by adjusting the parameters in the corresponding code.
